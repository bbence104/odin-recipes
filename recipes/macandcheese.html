        <h2>Easy Stove-top Mac and Cheese is the easiest and most delicious Mac and cheese ever! Ready in just 15 minutes, this is an amazing weeknight dinner for busy families!</h2>
        <h2>Mac and cheese is the ultimate comfort food. Is it because we have fond memories of the Blue Box as a kid? Possibly. Is it the irresistible cheesiness? Most definitely. While the Blue Box was great back in the day, our tastes have matured to move away from the store-bought mac and cheese. If you’ve never had made-from-scratch mac and cheese, you are in for a serious treat. We know parents and kids will agree that the real cheddar cheese in this creamy sauce just can’t be beat. </h2>
